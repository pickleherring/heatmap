* **Who made this?**

Thanks for asking. I did. I am a writer of raunchy stories with a sideline in computer stuff. You can find all my links and stories [here](https://linktr.ee/pickleherring) (be warned, my web pages are NSFW!). If you want to tweet your results from the heatmap app you are welcome to tag me [@prehensileballs](https://twitter.com/prehensileballs).

* **How did you make this?**

You can see the source code for the app on [GitHub](https://github.com/pickleherring/heatmap), including the [list of words](https://github.com/pickleherring/heatmap/blob/main/sex_terms.txt) that the app searches for in order to calculate the 'heat score'.
